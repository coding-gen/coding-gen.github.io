<h1 id="fun-quote">Fun quote</h1>
<p>You might say my first language was C, but I was studying Spanish even before that!</p>

<h1 id="bio">Bio</h1>
<p>My dual interests in computer science and human languages has drawn me in to studying Natural Language Processing. I am currently finishing my masters degree in computer science, specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence. As part of these studies, I am researching how multilingual language models improve performance on low resource languages. Before going back to school full time, I worked at SingleStore (cloud, distributed, SQL database software) for 5 years. This equipped me with the necessary skills to work with large datasets, perform ETL processes, and design scalable data architectures. Additionally, I specialized in query optimization and performance tuning at SingleStore. I won several awards for developing these skills and giving trainings on them. My combination of technical expertise in NLP and database management makes me an ideal candidate even for small teams where NLP engineers need to do their own data wrangling.</p>

<p>While a lot of NLP engineers come from a purely Machine Learning viewpoint, I bring additional background in linguistics. As a polyglot, I speak four languages: English, Spanish, French, and German. I’m always looking to learn new languages. I’ve dabbled in Arabic, Russian, and Wolof and am currently studying Japanese! This linguistic background has provided me with a deep understanding of the complexities of language, and how it can be processed and analyzed by machine learning models. My diverse background and experience give me a unique perspective that will be valuable in solving complex NLP challenges.</p>

<p>With this combination of skills in NLP, ML, Data Engineering, and linguistics, I’m excited to pursue a role as an NLP Engineer. Please see this portfolio as examples of my work in this area.</p>

<h3 id="nlp-implementations"><a href="https://github.com/coding-gen/nlp-research">NLP Implementations</a></h3>
<p>A collection of coding practice using common NLP toolkits and libraries.</p>

<h3 id="greenthumb"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sadCqoHJYp8">GreenThumb</a></h3>
<p>A gardening chatbot and recommender system built in DialogFlow during my course in Voice Assistants and Chatbots</p>

<h3 id="music-source-separation"><a href="https://github.com/coding-gen/cs510-comp-sound-music/tree/main/project-music-source-separation">Music Source Separation</a></h3>
<p>An exercise in audio processing for my course Computers, Sound, and Music. This project explores the strengths and weaknesses of current music source separation  models, and how effectively they can be applied to audio source separation.</p>

<h2 id="data-engineering-and-database-management">Data Engineering and Database Management</h2>

<h3 id="c-tran-breadcrumbs-pipeline"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPv2SXW0Kp4">C-Tran Breadcrumbs Pipeline</a></h3>
<p>Kafka data pipeline handling realtime C-Tran bus data. For the course: Data Engineering. I won first prizes for best presentation, and for best extended features (I added logging, data backups and multiple modes of ingestion, as well as a guarantee to insert only once to protect from collisions)</p>

<h3 id="portal-highway-data-analysis-in-spark"><a href="https://github.com/jnickg/dataproc-highways">Portal Highway Data Analysis in Spark</a></h3>
<p>An analysis of automobile throughput and speed on a portion of interstate highway 205 from 2020. Including experimentation with cluster size and partitioning in Spark. Created for course CS-588 Cloud and clustering databases.</p>

<h3 id="key-singlestore-database-architectural-components"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgNWb9Wkxf8">Key SingleStore Database Architectural Components</a></h3>
<p>At SingleStore, I created an internal training to familiarize new hires in Customer Success with the major features of SingleStore database software. In this public training linked here, I go over a portion of the slides from that training, and demonstrate each of those components and how you can view and interact with them on a live cluster. In particular I show how data is partitioned and where it is stored in the cluster, demonstrating the shared-nothing architechture of SingleStore. This includes an example of how to create each supported table type, the differences in how they are stored, how memory management is exposed for monitoring, differences in aggregator types, common node file structures, as well as how to avoid common issues in creating test tables with dummy data.</p>

<h3 id="query-processing-and-caching-in-singlestore-database"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLmEK0UK280">Query Processing and Caching in SingleStore Database</a></h3>
<p>While at SingleStore, I created an internal training to familiarize the new Customer Support team in India with elements of query processing. This is a portion of that training, focusing on query plancaching, which I recorded for posting publicly. In this training video, I walk through how a query plan is generated by the optimizer, how query plans are cached for reuse, and how you can view and modify this behavior, including resolution of common issues.</p>
