# project-portfolio
This portfolio demonstrates the work I've done both in pursing a Masters in Computer Science specializing in Natural Language Processing, as well as for personal projects.

# Fun quote
You might say my first language was C, but I was studying Spanish even before that! 

# Bio 
My dual interests in computer science and human languages has drawn me in to studying Natural Language Processing. I am currently finishing my masters degree in computer science, specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence. As part of these studies, I am researching how multilingual language models improve performance on low resource languages. Before going back to school full time, I worked at SingleStore (cloud, distributed, SQL database software) for 5 years. This equipped me with the necessary skills to work with large datasets, perform ETL processes, and design scalable data architectures. Additionally, I specialized in query optimization and performance tuning at SingleStore. I won several awards for developing these skills and giving trainings on them. My combination of technical expertise in NLP and database management makes me an ideal candidate even for small teams where NLP engineers need to do their own data wrangling. 

While a lot of NLP engineers come from a purely Machine Learning viewpoint, I bring additional background in linguistics. As a polyglot, I speak four languages: English, Spanish, French, and German. I'm always looking to learn new languages. I've dabbled in Arabic, Russian, and Wolof and am currently studying Japanese! This linguistic background has provided me with a deep understanding of the complexities of language, and how it can be processed and analyzed by machine learning models. My diverse background and experience give me a unique perspective that will be valuable in solving complex NLP challenges.

With this combination of skills in NLP, ML, Data Engineering, and linguistics, I'm excited to pursue a role as an NLP Engineer. Please see this portfolio as examples of my work in this area.


# Projects

## Natural Language Processing

### 3-Class Sentiment Classification Pipeline
An NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis of customer feedback as positive, neutral or negative. Includes database connection, text preprocessing, running the models, evaluation and comparison of models, and visualization of results.

### Music Source Separation
An exercise in audio processing for my course Computers, Sound, and Music. This project explores the strengths and weaknesses of current music source separation  models, and how effectively they can be applied to audio source separation.

## Database Engineering

### C-Tran Breadcrumbs Pipeline
Kafka data pipeline handling realtime C-Tran bus data. For the course: Data Engineering. I won first prizes for best presentation, and for best extended features (I added logging, data backups and multiple modes of ingestion, as well as a guarantee to insert only once to protect from collisions)

## Cloud

### DoWeNeedBananas? 
A simple collaborative grocery list website making use of the GCP Cloud Vision API and Kroger API, deployed as a Docker container on Cloud Run. For the course: Internet Web and Cloud.
